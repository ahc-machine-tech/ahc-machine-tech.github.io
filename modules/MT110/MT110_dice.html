Introduction
==================================
The focus of this lab is to set up and generate the Gcode for the base of the
arbor press as well as preparing the CNC mill and fully machining the base.

This lab will cover the following topics:
- CAM setup.
- CAM operations such as drilling, face, 2d and 3d operations.
- Tool selection and creation in fusion 360.
- Generation of NC program and setup sheet.
- Loading tools into the CNC mill
- Setting tool lengths in the CNC mill
- Setting up the stock material based on the CAM setup
- Configuring work offsets and coordinate system.
- Soft jaws.



1 - Base OP1
==================================
Given the geometry of the base, it will be necessary to have multiple programs
in order to finish the part since we cannot machine both the top and the bottom
of the piece in one operation.

### Measuring the Stock Material

[[y! Stock Material

Make sure you have a set of **calipers** and the **stock** material that will be 
used for this lab.

]]
Using the calipers, measure the width, height, and thickness of the stock 
material and write the dimensions down.

OP1 Setup
-----------------------------

This section focuses on creating a new setup for OP1 and all the 
necessary CAM operations for the base in Fusion 360.
To get started, open the arbor press project in fusion 360.
Under the **Manufacture** workspace, go to Models->ArborPress, and right click
on the base select isolate.
ADD PICTURES
Create a new setup by clicking the setup button under the Milling menu.

 ### b. Facing the stock material
 
 ### c. Drilling and boring
 
 ### d. Adaptive operation
 
 ### e. Finishing pass and chamfering using 2d contour
 
 ### f. Tapping
 
 Generating the NC program and setup sheet for OP1
 -----------------------------
 plug in a flashdrive
 go to postprocess 
 select profile
 change max feedrate?
 under commend add your Name
 output directory select your flashdrive
 name the program a number between "1" and "9999"
 click post
 now your program should be saved to the flashdrive.

[[y! Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required for this section of the lab: 
- Tool length offsets are expected to be already set up in the machine previous
to starting this section.
For more information about setting tool length offsets go to Lab 1. 

]]

- Loading the stock material in the vise.
- Setting up the WCS(for step by step instructions go to Lab 1)
- load the program for OP1 generated in previous section
- start the program. and set up the speed to 25% while keeping your finger 
on the stop feed button in case something goes wrong.
- press feed stop when you observe the first tool about 1 inch above the stock.
 double check in the screen that the Z position is about 1 inch away from the 
 stock material. If the numbers don't match with what you are seeing, stop and 
 double check your work.
- change speed% accordingly while carefully monitoring all the operations.
always be ready to press the stop feed button if something goes wrong.
- wait for the machine to finish.
- Once OP1 has completed, remove the part and continue with the next section.

2 - Soft Jaws
==================================
[[b! Soft Jaws

Soft jaws are vise jaws often machined out of aluminum or steel. 
Their purpose is to fixture parts that are oddly shaped and cannot be easily
held by the flat jaws of a vise.

]]

To continue with the second and final operation needed to complete the base, 
soft jaws will be needed.
